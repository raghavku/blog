<h1>Bitcoin Price Fluctuation &amp; Prediction</h1>
<p>My first blogpost is about predicting Bitcoin currency value. Fun Fact: An investment of $30 in Bitcoin in 2009 would be worth $1,000,000 today!</p>

<p>Since Bitcoin Prices are very volatile and do not carry a clear trend and seasonality, it was hard to predict accurate future values. This was especially true when trying to predict using a large amount of historical data, such as a five-year horizon. However, after running multiple models and reducing the data to more recent values, such as the past six months, I could generate a model that is reasonably accurate and robust.</p>
<p>The model that performed the best was the ARIMA model (*To learn about ARIMA models, visit <a href="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/66*" class="uri">https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/66*</a>). Despite the high fluctuation of the data, this model performed well without being overly complex. This could potentially translate into a valuable investment opportunity by giving insight into when we should buy Bitcoin to return a profit. At the same time, the models worked primarily in predicting future short-term data and did not give acceptable means to predict sharp future changes in trend; this could result in missed opportunities or detrimental investments.</p>
<p>To gain further understanding of the price fluctuation and to potentially mitigate weakness in prediction of the models, I analyzed variables that appeared to correlate with Bitcoin prices. The variable that had the highest correlation out of 6 external economic indicators as the Dollar/Yuan Exchange rate. With this variable, one can potentially predict sudden changes in Bitcoin prices and help gain a deeper insight into the nature of this currency.</p>
<p>From my analysis, I learned that for this volatile and unpredictable currency, it is best to use a model with more recent data and that it surprisingly does not require highly complex modeling to generate forecasts with reasonable accuracy. Additionally, I found that even with such unpredictable data, other variables could be correlated and give insight in how one can better predict Bitcoin prices in the future.</p>
