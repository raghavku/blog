<h2>How To Become A Data Scientist</h2>
<p>Technical expertise: the best data scientists typically have deep expertise in some scientific discipline. • Curiosity: a desire to go beneath the surface and discover and distill a problem down into a very clear set of hypotheses that can be tested. • Storytelling: the ability to use data to tell a story and to be able to communicate it effectively. • Cleverness: the ability to look at a problem in different, creative ways</p>
<p>Common Myth: People often assume that data scientists need a background in computer science. In my experience, that hasn’t been the case: my best data scientists have come from very different backgrounds. The inventor of LinkedIn’s People You May Know was an experimental physicist. A computational chemist on my decision sciences team had solved a 100-year-old problem on energy states of water. An oceanographer made major impacts on the way we identify fraud. Perhaps most surprising was the neurosurgeon who turned out to be a wizard at identifying rich underlying trends in the data</p>
<p>Demand and Supply: One of the challenges of identifying data scientists is that there aren’t many of them (yet). There are a number of programs that are helping train people, but the demand outstrips the supply. And experiences like my own suggest that the best way to become a data scientist isn’t to be trained as a data scientist, but to do serious, data-intensive work in some other discipline</p>
<p>3 IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS: Would we be willing to do a startup with you? This is the first question we ask ourselves as a team when we meet to evaluate a candidate. It sums up a number of key criteria: • Time: If we’re willing to do a startup with you, we’re agreeing that we’d be willing to be locked in a small room with you for long periods of time. The ability to enjoy another person’s company is critical to being able to invest in each other’s growth. • Trust: Can we trust you? Will we have to look over your shoulder to make sure you’re doing an A+ job? That may go without saying, but the reverse is also important: will you trust me? If you don’t trust me, we’re both in trouble. • Communication: Can we communicate with each other quickly and efficiently? If we’re going to spend a tremendous amount of time together and if we need to trust each other, we’ll need to communicate. Over time, we should be able to anticipate each other’s needs in a way that allows us to be highly efficient</p>
