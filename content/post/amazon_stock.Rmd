#Objective: To analyze and forecast closing prices of Amazon Inc.'s (AMZN) stock using machine learning extrapolatory algorithms.

Data: The data has been extracted from _quantmod_ package. I have used AMZN stock's closing prices for the past 2 years. For further details on quantmod visit: http://www.quantmod.com/

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
chooseCRANmirror(graphics=FALSE, ind=1)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
install.packages("forecast")
install.packages("quantmod")
install.packages("evaluate")
```

##Loading required packages
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(xts)
library(zoo)
library(quantmod)
getSymbols("AMZN",from="2015-06-15", to = "2017-06-15")
```
##Plot showing 5 year historical stock price
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
chartSeries(AMZN$AMZN.Close)
```

##Smoothing data to take the average of every 21 days (trading days in a month)
```{r}
close.data=AMZN$AMZN.Close
library(zoo)
ma.centered = rollmean(close.data,k=21, align="center")
ma.trailing = rollmean(close.data,k=21, align="right")
```

##Plot showing daily closing stock prices and moving averages (trailing and centered)
```{r}
plot(close.data,
     ylab = "Stock Price", # label for y-axis
     xlab = "Time",  # label for x-axis
     bty = "l", 
     main = "Amazon Closing Stock Prices"
     )
lines(ma.centered, lwd = 2, col=2) 
lines(ma.trailing, lwd = 2, lty = 2, col = "blue") 

```

##Creating training and validation sets to create Time Series Prediction

Clearly, a Moving Average Percent Error (MAPE) of 6.7% shows a good estimate for a one month  validation period.
```{r}
#Split the data into training and validation
nValid = 30 #One month validation period
w = 21 #Moving average window (trading days in a month)
nTrain = length(close.data) - nValid #23 month long training period
train.ts = close.data[1:nTrain]
valid.ts = close.data[(nTrain+1):(nTrain+nValid)]


library(zoo)
library(forecast)
# Fit a trailing average smoother
ma.trailing = rollmean(train.ts, k = w)

# Find the last moving average in the taining period
last.ma = tail(ma.trailing, 1)

# Use the last moving average as the prediction for each month in the validation period
ma.trailing.pred = ts(rep(last.ma, nValid))

# let's find the actual observed average over the validation period
accuracy(ma.trailing.pred,valid.ts)
```

##Plot showing prediction vs. actual stock price (Moving Average Method)

Assuming that we use the Moving Average method to predict AMZN stock price for the next two weeks, we can be 93.3% sure that the value will be approximately $976.
```{r}
library(xts)
library(zoo)
pred1<-xts(ma.trailing.pred,order.by=index(valid.ts))
plot(valid.ts, ylim=c(900,1100), main="Moving Average Test On Validation Period", ylab="Closing Price")
lines(pred1,col="blue")
```

##Plot showing prediction vs. actual stock price (Holt Winter's Model)

The AAN Holt Winter's Model _(Explained here: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/7/5)_ accounts for Additive Noise and Trend. It is highly robust and accurate as it provides a MAPE of 1.19% on the training set and 1.49% on the test set. This model suggests that AMZN's stock will provide a 3.5% return on investment in one month.

Assuming that the Holt Winter's Model is fairly accurate, AMZN's stock price will be around $1010 one month from now.

```{r}
hw <- ets(train.ts, model = "ZZZ")
hw.pred <- forecast(hw, h = nValid, level = 0)

M3$method

accuracy(hw.pred, valid.ts)[,5]

plot(hw.pred)
lines(valid.ts, lty=2)

hw_pred <- ets(close.data, model = "AAN")
hw_pred <- forecast(hw_pred, h = 30, level = 0)

hw_pred$mean
```

#Correlation Test Between Amazon, Ebay and Best Buy Stocks

##A Great Year For E-Commerce Companies
To understand how Amazon's competitors are performing in relation to its stock, I performed a linear regression analysis with Ebay and Best Buy's one year stocks. Clearly, both stocks were statistically significant in my assessment and showed decent R-squared values. Correlation between Amazon and Ebay was 79%, and 84% between Amazon and Best Buy. Thus, in general all three companies follow a positive trend and are outperforming the S&P 500. 

```{r}
library(quantmod)
getSymbols("AMZN",from="2016-06-15", to = "2017-06-15") # Amazon
getSymbols("EBAY",from="2016-06-15", to = "2017-06-15") # Ebay
getSymbols("BBY",from="2016-06-15", to = "2017-06-15") # Best Buy
AMZN = as.data.frame(AMZN[,4])
EBAY = as.data.frame(EBAY[,4])
BBY = as.data.frame(BBY[,4])
stocks = cbind(AMZN, EBAY,BBY)
summary(stocks)

library(stats)
l1= lm(stocks$AMZN.Close ~ stocks$EBAY.Close,stocks)
l2 = lm(stocks$AMZN.Close ~ stocks$BBY.Close,stocks)
summary(l1)
summary(l2)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(stocks, aes(x=stocks$AMZN.Close, y=stocks$EBAY.Close)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() + stat_smooth(method="lm",colour="blue", se=FALSE) + ggtitle("Correlation: AMZN and EBAY")

ggplot(stocks, aes(x=stocks$AMZN.Close, y=stocks$BBY.Close)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() + stat_smooth(method="lm",colour="blue", se=FALSE) + ggtitle("Correlation: AMZN and BBY")
